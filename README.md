# Hi, I'm Chris 👋

I'm a practical, hands-on person who enjoys fixing small but annoying problems with code.

Most of my projects start the same way:  
something doesn’t work as expected, there’s no proper tool for it, and doing it manually feels wrong.  
So I try to automate it.

---

## What I’m doing right now

- Working on small **JavaScript browser scripts** and utilities
- Building simple tools that solve real, everyday problems
- Gradually improving my frontend skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Keeping projects minimal, readable, and practical

I care less about flashy tech stacks and more about things that actually work.

## Selected interests

- Automation and scripting
- Browser-based tools
- Fixing UX problems with code
- Simple solutions instead of complex frameworks

---

## Tech I use (and actually touch)

- JavaScript
- HTML / CSS
- Python (for scripting and automation)
- Basic frontend tooling

I prefer learning things when I need them, not collecting badges.
